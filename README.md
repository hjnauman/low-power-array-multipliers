# low-power-array-multipliers
This project displays a verilog implementation of three generic nxn array multipliers. A standard nxn array multiplier is given as a starting point for the following two low power array multipliers. Column bypassed and row bypassed array multipliers were implemented during this project to display the benefits of both implementations. All testing was performed in Vivado's HLS tools.
