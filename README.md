# low-power-array-multipliers
This project displays a generic nxn implementation of three array multipliers. A standard nxn array multiplier is given as a starting point for the following two low power array multipliers. Column bypassed and row bypassed array multipliers were implemented during this project to display the benefits of both implementations. All testing was performed in Vivado's HLS tools.
